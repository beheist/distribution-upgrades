# distribution-upgrades

Contains script resources for upgrading Flow and Neos distributions.
Currently this is meant to upgrade Flow 3.x installations to Flow 4.0 and
Neos 2.x installations to 3.0. Maybe this script will become a generalized
distribution upgrade helper in the future.


## Build
 The `build` folder contains a script to create a phar file containing the updater.
